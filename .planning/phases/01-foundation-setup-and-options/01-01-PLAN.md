<objective>
Create the runnable app/tooling baseline and deployment pipeline so all later feature plans can iterate on a real GitHub Pages-ready SPA.

Purpose: Eliminate environment and deployment uncertainty before building wizard behavior.
Output: Bun-managed React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold, hash-router boot entry, and official GitHub Pages workflow.
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Initialize Bun + Vite + TypeScript project baseline</name>
  <files>package.json, bun.lock, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json, index.html, src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/styles.css</files>
  <action>Create the initial SPA scaffold using Bun-managed dependencies and TypeScript config. Define Bun scripts `dev`, `build`, and `lint` in package scripts. Add a minimal app shell that renders through `HashRouter` from `react-router` so static hosting deep links are server-safe from day one. Keep the shell intentionally minimal (no feature logic) to reduce merge conflicts with later plans.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun install && bun run build` and confirm the command exits 0 and emits `dist/`.</verify>
  <done>Repository builds successfully with Bun and has a compilable SPA entrypoint using hash-based routing.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Configure GitHub Pages runtime and asset base</name>
  <files>vite.config.ts, src/main.tsx</files>
  <action>Set Vite `base` for project-page deployment and ensure app boot uses hash routing (`HashRouter`) instead of browser history routing. Keep routing mode explicit in source to prevent accidental fallback to BrowserRouter in later phases.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun run build` and inspect generated `dist/index.html` asset URLs include the configured Vite base prefix.</verify>
  <done>Build output resolves assets under repository base and uses hash URLs for client navigation.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add official GitHub Pages Actions workflow</name>
  <files>.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml</files>
  <action>Create a Pages workflow using `actions/configure-pages`, `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, and `actions/deploy-pages` with required permissions (`contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`). Use Bun in CI for install/build and upload `./dist` artifact. Do not use legacy `gh-pages` branch push flow.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun run build` locally, then validate workflow YAML includes build and deploy jobs with deploy job `needs: build` and artifact path `./dist`.</verify>
  <done>Workflow file is present and structurally aligned with GitHub Pages official static deployment contract.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Confirm `bun run dev`, `bun run build`, and `bun run lint` are available and build output is deployable by Pages workflow.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
DEP-01, DEP-02, DEP-03, and DEP-04 foundations are in place: hash-router SPA bootstrap, Vite base configured for Pages, official Actions deploy workflow, and Bun command surface works locally.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-setup-and-options/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
