<objective>
Implement option-domain primitives so UI and route layers can enforce a single source of truth for option validity and minimum-count readiness.

Purpose: Separate option business rules from component wiring to keep execution scope focused and reduce context strain.
Output: Typed option model, action helpers, validation schema, reorder utility, and reducer integration points.
</objective>

  <action>Define option model with stable id and explicit `order` field plus optional metadata fields used in phase-1 UX. Create Zod schema for required option title with optional description/icon, and add a dedicated Zod gate schema for step readiness (`>=2` options) to satisfy the locked rule that all step gates use Zod. Implement minimum-option helper(s) that delegate to this Zod gate validator so route guards and UI continuation checks reuse identical logic.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun run build`, then run a quick node/ts test snippet invoking the gate validator with 1 option (fails) and 2 options (passes) to confirm Zod-backed step-gate behavior.</verify>
  <done>Option data contract and Zod-backed prerequisite gate logic are centralized and ready for component and router integration.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Implement reusable option action creators and reducer integration</name>
  <files>src/features/options/state/option.actions.ts, src/features/options/utils/reorderOptions.ts, src/features/decision/state/draft.reducer.ts</files>
  <action>Create typed action creators for add/edit/delete/reorder operations that preserve stable ids and normalize order after mutations. Reorder operations must support button-driven moves (up, down, top, bottom) as the phase-1 baseline, not drag-and-drop. Implement reducer cases that apply these actions immutably against canonical draft state. Do not wire route components in this plan; keep integration points focused on domain/state layers only.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun run build` and verify reducer handles option action payloads without type assertions or `any` casts.</verify>
  <done>Canonical draft reducer can execute option CRUD/reorder transitions using shared typed action payloads and order-normalization helper.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Run `bun run build` and confirm option state primitives compile cleanly and are consumable by upcoming UI/route integration plan.

<success_criteria>
Option domain foundations for OPT-01 through OPT-04 are in place with stable ordering semantics, reusable validation, and minimum-option prerequisite helpers ready for UI/router consumption.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-setup-and-options/01-04-SUMMARY.md`
