<objective>
Wire the wizard route shell and decision-step guard structure so later setup/option plans can focus on concrete UI behavior instead of route scaffolding.

Purpose: Split route topology and guard plumbing from state/domain setup to reduce context load and avoid cross-cutting edits.
Output: App/router wiring, explicit placeholder routes, and decision prerequisite guard integration points.
</objective>

  <action>Create explicit hash-routed step paths for decision setup, options, criteria, ratings, and results with lightweight placeholder UIs. Wire `App` to compose draft provider and router once so route components consume centralized state context consistently. Keep route path names stable to preserve deep-link contracts for upcoming plans.</action>
  <verify>Run `bun run dev`, navigate to each hash route, and confirm all routes render without runtime errors (placeholder content is acceptable).</verify>
  <done>All phase-1 wizard steps are routable through a single app-level router/provider composition.</done>

  <action>Use `isDecisionStepComplete` helper from decision state to guard forward navigation out of setup start. Enforce protection in route wrappers/redirection logic (not only button disabled states) so direct URL access cannot bypass decision-step completion requirements.</action>
  <verify>With empty draft state, navigate directly to `#/setup/options` and later-step routes, and confirm router redirects to decision setup instead of rendering protected content.</verify>
  <done>Decision prerequisite enforcement exists at route level and blocks deep-link bypass before decision data is valid.</done>

</tasks>

<verification>
Validate shell behavior end-to-end: step routes resolve, app/provider wiring holds state context, and route-level decision guards block invalid direct navigation.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
DEC-03 and DEC-04 route-shell prerequisites are structurally ready: explicit step routes exist and decision completion is enforced through centralized route guards.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-setup-and-options/01-06-SUMMARY.md`
