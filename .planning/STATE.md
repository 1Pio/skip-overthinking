## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1-5 structure follows requirement clusters and dependency order.
- Scoring integrity requirements are grouped before results to protect explainability.
- [Phase 01]: Use Bun scripts as the single local command surface (dev/build/lint).
- [Phase 01]: Keep App and entrypoint minimal until routing/provider plans to avoid early coupling.
