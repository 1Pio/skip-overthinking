# Coding Conventions

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-16

## Naming Patterns

**Files:**
- Implementation file naming conventions are not detected because no application source files exist under `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, or `tests/`.
- Existing project files use mixed naming styles: kebab-case in `.planning/pre-execution-project-research/What-And-How-To-Build.md` with internal title-casing words, and uppercase in `LICENSE`.

**Functions:**
- Not detected. No executable source files (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.py`, `*.go`, `*.rs`) are present.

**Variables:**
- Not detected. No executable source files are present.

**Types:**
- Not detected. No TypeScript or other typed language source files are present.

## Code Style

**Formatting:**
- Formatting tool configuration is not detected (`.prettierrc*`, `biome.json`, and equivalent formatter configs are absent).
- The only substantive document, `.planning/pre-execution-project-research/What-And-How-To-Build.md`, follows Markdown heading hierarchy and list-driven specification style.

**Linting:**
- Linting tool configuration is not detected (`.eslintrc*`, `eslint.config.*`, and equivalent linter configs are absent).
- No enforceable lint rules are currently defined in repository configuration files.

## Import Organization

**Order:**
1. Not detected (no source files with import statements exist)
2. Not detected
3. Not detected

**Path Aliases:**
- Not detected (`tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, and equivalent alias-bearing configs are absent).

## Error Handling

**Patterns:**
- Not detected. No runtime code is present to establish try/catch, Result-type, or exception-handling patterns.

## Logging

**Framework:** Not detected

**Patterns:**
- Not detected. No runtime code is present.

## Comments

**When to Comment:**
- In Markdown planning content, explanatory prose is embedded directly as specification text rather than inline code comments in `.planning/pre-execution-project-research/What-And-How-To-Build.md`.

**JSDoc/TSDoc:**
- Not detected. No JavaScript/TypeScript source files are present.

## Function Design

**Size:**
- Not detected.

**Parameters:**
- Not detected.

**Return Values:**
- Not detected.

## Module Design

**Exports:**
- Not detected. No modules are implemented in the current repository state.

**Barrel Files:**
- Not detected (`index.ts`/`index.js` barrel patterns are absent).
